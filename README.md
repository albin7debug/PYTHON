## Discriptive Statistics in python
Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or a sample of a population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread).
A large number of methods collectively compute descriptive statistics and other related operations on DataFrame. Most of these are aggregations like sum(), mean(), but some of them, like sumsum(), produce an object of the same size. Generally speaking, these methods take an axis argument, just like ndarray.{sum, std, ...}, but the axis can be specified by name or integer.
